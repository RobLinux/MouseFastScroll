# Mouse Fast Scroll extension for Visual Studio 2010+

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/bxcpp55od7oo11si/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sharwell/mousefastscroll/branch/master)

This extension performs two tasks that I simply can't live without:

1. Pressing the Control key while scrolling the mouse wheel up/down shifts the view by one page up/down.
2. Disable the Ctrl+Mouse Wheel to zoom "feature".

I originally added this feature to Visual Studio .NET (based on a very positive experience with ConTEXT long ago) and updated it for each Visual Studio release until finally releasing it as open source software.
